# SAPFOR (System FOR Automated Parallelization)

SAPFOR is a software development suit that is focused on cost reduction of manual program parallelization. It was primarily designed to perform source-to-source transformation of a sequential program for execution on heterogeneous clusters.

SAPFOR repository is intended to collect other repositories of this project that makes it easier to download separate repositories and to organize them in required directory tree.

To download all parts of SAPFOR at once, use command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dvm-system/sapfor.git
```
